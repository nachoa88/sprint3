    As for the ApplicationController, it's often used as a base controller that other controllers extend. 
    It's a place to put code that is shared across multiple controllers. For example, you might 
    put code in the ApplicationController to:
    - Check if a user is logged in before allowing them to access certain routes
    - Set up common variables or data that all controllers need
    - Handle common tasks like rendering views or redirecting users
